" methods of selectively etching tungsten relative to silicon-containing films (e.g. silicon oxide, silicon carbon nitride and (poly)silicon) as well as tungsten oxide are described. the methods include a remote plasma etch formed from a fluorine-containing precursor and/or hydrogen (h.sub.2). plasma effluents from the remote plasma are flowed into a substrate processing region where the plasma effluents react with the tungsten. the plasma effluents react with exposed surfaces and selectively remove tungsten while very slowly removing other exposed materials. sequential and simultaneous methods are included to remove thin tungsten oxide which may, for example, result from exposure to the atmosphere."
