" disclosed are methods, systems and apparatus for manufacturing complex three dimensional open structures by cold forming the component from unhardened metal stock and then selectively heating and quenching the metal to provide the desired strength profile across the component. the metal is initially formed of unheated and unhardened metal through a combination of rolling, stamping and/or milling operations to produce a component having a complex three dimensional open structure. the formed component is then hardened in strategically predetermined areas by sequentially heating and quenching the predetermined areas of the component. the heating and cooling elements are, in turn, provided on at least one robotic apparatus configured for moving the elements across the surface of the component in a manner sufficient to achieve the desired pattern of hardened and unhardened regions across the component."
