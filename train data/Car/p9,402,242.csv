" methods and systems for association management within a wireless node network of nodes and a server are described. a method may identify a first node as a potential for associating with a second node based, for example, upon status information about the nodes. an association request is transmitted by the second node to the server. the server may determine the locations of the nodes, determine if associating the nodes is desired based on the locations, and record new association data if association should occur. upon receiving a permissive response from the server, which may include one or more authorization credentials, the first node and second node may be associated. then with authorization credentials, the first and second nodes may securely connect and share data. and once associated, responsibility for a task previously done by the first node may be shifted to the second node after the nodes are associated."
