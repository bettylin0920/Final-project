" presented is a method and apparatus comprising one or more robotic members which are curvaceous or snake-like; having movable shapers through which may pass an articulable column having successive joints formed of alternating ball and socket members. the shapers can be directed up and down the articulable column, to create virtually any radius of curvature, in any direction. the robotic member may also include discrete microelectronic mechanical devices (mems) shapers with embedded addressable controllers. thus the device, with computerized control is capable of negotiating a tortuous path to access the site of a given operation and to retreat along the same path, without injury to the body in which the arm is directed. once at the work site, the articulating columns, or parts of them, may be put in compression, causing them to become rigid."
