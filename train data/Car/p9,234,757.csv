" methods and systems for enhanced node location determination by varying a power characteristic of nodes in a wireless node network are described. at least one of the nodes is instructed by a managing element in the network to incrementally change the power characteristic (e.g., change output power level and/or node receiver sensitivity). as the power characteristic incrementally changes, nodes are identified that initially received a signal broadcast from a first of the nodes but no longer receive the broadcast signal. as the power characteristic continues to incrementally change, a node is identified as a last of the nodes that receives the broadcast signal before none of the other nodes can receive the broadcast signal. as such, the identified last of the other nodes is a closest node to the first node. then, a location of the first node is determined based upon the closest node to the first node."
