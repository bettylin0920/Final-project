" redundant robotic manipulators may be constrained in their motions during operation in a gravity-compensated mode by applying, in addition to gravity-compensating torques, constraining torques to one or more of the joints. the constraining torques may urge the manipulator to a specified canonical posture, and may be modeled by virtual springs attached to the constrained joints."
