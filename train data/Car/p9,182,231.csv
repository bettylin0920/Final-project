" methods and systems are described for creating a hierarchical sensor network for enhanced monitoring of a grouped set of packages being shipped, the hierarchical sensor network using a wireless node network having a mobile master node, an id node and a server. the mobile master node can communicate directly with the server over a first communication path, and is placed within a package in the grouped packages. the id node can communicate directly with the master node over a second communication path but cannot communicate directly with the server over the first communication path. the id node is placed within another package in the grouped packages. the mobile master node and the id node are enabled with power, and the hierarchical sensor network for the grouped packages is activated by causing the server to associate the mobile master node with the id node."
