" an approach for providing location sharing via simulation is disclosed. a location sharing platform determines at least one location point associated with at least one device and at least one algorithm for determining at least one predicted route of the at least one device based, at least in part, on the at least one location point. the location sharing platform then causes, at least in part, a transmission of the at least one location point and the at least one algorithm to at least one other device for generating location tracking information."
