" the present invention relates to a manufacturing method for advanced high-strength steel (ahss) wheel, comprising the following steps. take an ahss with at least 590 mpa of tensile strength for rolling to circular ring of a rim. apply low heat input welding, such as the cold metal transfer (cmt) welding or the gas tungsten arc welding/tungsten inert gas arc welding (gtaw/tig), at the junction of the rim to form a hollow cylindrical rim. then perform hole expanding and spinning/roll forming operations to the rim. take another ahss with at least 980 mpa of tensile strength for pressing and forming a disk. apply low heat input welding, such as cold metal transfer (cmt) welding, to the rim and the disk to produce a wheel. according to the present invention, the welding quality of products can be improved significantly; the fatigue lifetime of wheels can be enhanced; and wheels are lightweight."
