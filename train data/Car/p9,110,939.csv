" an approach is provided for incremental database updates based on delta pages. an update platform determines at least one new page of a first database and at least one reference page of a second database. the update platform then processes and/or facilitates a processing of the at least one new page and the at least one reference page to determine at least one difference patch comprising one or more differences between the at least one new page and the at least one reference page. in one embodiment, the at least one new page can be constructed from the at least one reference page and the at least one difference patch."
