 an apparatus and method to cradle and hem panels at an assembly-line station. a cradle assembly is configured to conform to the shape of a first sheet material and prevents deformation of the class-a surfaces. a first robotic arm operatively associated with said cradle assembly and a slide-assist assembly cooperate to stabilize the cradle and secure a cradle anvil against the first sheet material. a roller head for hemming said first sheet material supported on a second robotic arm. the second robotic arm moves the roller head around the periphery of the first sheet material and against the cradle anvil to form a hem.
