 a noninvasive brain computer interface (bci) system includes an electroencephalography (eeg) electrode array configured to acquire eeg signals generated by a subject. the subject observes movement of a stimulus. a computer is coupled to the eeg electrode array and configured to collected and process the acquired eeg signals. a decoding algorithm is used that analyzes low-frequency (delta band) brain waves in the time domain to continuously decode neural activity associated with the observed movement.
