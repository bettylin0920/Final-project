" improved methods and apparatus are described for adaptively adjusting a node power level in a wireless node network having a plurality of nodes and a server. in one method, the server is operative to fix an output power setting on a first node (such as an id node or master node) to a first power level when the first node is located in a first area. the first power level corresponds to a density of the nodes operating within the first area. the server then detects if the first node has moved to a second area. when the first node is detected as being in the second area, the server adapts the output power setting on the first node to a second power level. the second power level corresponds and relates to a density of the nodes operating within the second area."
