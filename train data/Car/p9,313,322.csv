" techniques to derive or predict location context for a user of a mobile device include receiving signal data that indicates a set of one or more distinct signal sources from which signals are received at the mobile device for each of multiple different times. the method further comprises determining whether the mobile device is moving outside a specified area at a current time based on the signal data. the method further comprises incrementing a count for a stationary state associated with the set of one or more distinct signal sources at the current time, if the mobile device is determined to be not moving outside the specified area. the method also comprises delivering a service to the mobile device based on the stationary state."
