" an approach is provided for synchronizing traffic flow and/or traffic signals in alternate travel segments. the approach involves determining traffic congestion information for at least one travel segment that is classified in at least one first functional class. the approach also involves processing and/or facilitating a processing of the traffic congestion information to determine at least one alternate travel segment that is classified in at least one second functional class. the approach further involves determining at least one calculated traffic flow for the at least one alternate travel segment based, at least in part, on traffic flow information associated with the at least one first functional class. the approach also involves causing, at least in part, a configuration of one or more traffic signaling parameters for the at least one alternate travel segment based, at least in part, on the calculated traffic flow."
