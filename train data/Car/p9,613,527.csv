" an approach is provided for determining at least one first cluster set associated with at least one database of one or more navigable links at a first time period and at least one second cluster set associated with the at least one database at a second time period, wherein the at least one first cluster set and the at least one second cluster set include one or more clusters of the one or more navigable links. the approach involves causing, at least in part, a computation of a minimal matching between at least one first cluster set and the at least one second cluster set. the approach also involves causing, at least in part, a renaming of the one or more clusters in the at least one first cluster set, the at least one second cluster set, or a combination thereof based, at least in part, on the minimal matching, wherein the one or more clusters organize the one or more navigable links based, at least in part, on traffic pattern information."
