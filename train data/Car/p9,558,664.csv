" an approach is provided for parking availability detection based on vehicle trajectory information. a trajectory processing platform processes and/or facilitates a processing of trajectory data associated with at least one journey of at least one vehicle to determine at least one portion of the at least one journey that is associated at least one parking search by the at least one vehicle. the trajectory processing platform also determines one or more street segments associated with the at least one portion of the at least one journey. the trajectory processing platform further causes, at least in part, a classification of the one or more street segments as associated with the at least one parking search. the trajectory processing platform further determines parking availability information for the one or more street segments based, at least in part, on the trajectory data."
