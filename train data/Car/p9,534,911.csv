" an approach is provided for determining one or more non-travel lanes in at least one route segment. the approach involves obtaining data from a location database, the data comprising information with respect to at least one route segment including, at least in part, information on travel and non-travel lanes within the at least one travel route segment. the approach then involves determining one or more non-travel lanes in the at least one route segment based, at least in part, on the data. the approach further involves determining whether to include the at least one route segment in a navigation route based, at least in part, on a minimization of a risk of being blocked by the one or more non-travel lanes during a time a user is projected to travel."
