" system and method for using automated 3d scans to diagnose the mechanical status of substantially intact vehicles. one or more processor controlled 3d scanners utilize optical and other methods to assess the exposed surfaces of various vehicle components. computer vision and other computerized pattern recognition techniques then compare the 3d scanner output versus a reference computer database of these various vehicle components in various normal and malfunctioning states. those components judged to be aberrant are flagged. these flagged components can be reported to the vehicle users, as well as various insurance or repair entities. in some embodiments, the 3d scans can be performed using time-of-flight cameras, and optionally infrared, stereoscopic, and even audio sensors attached to the processor controlled arm of a mobile robot. much of the subsequent data analysis and management can be done using remote internet servers."
