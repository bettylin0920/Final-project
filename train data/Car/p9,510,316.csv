" methods, media, and node-enabled autonomous transport vehicles are described for navigating to a shipping location using a plurality of nodes in a wireless node network. a node associated with the autonomous transport vehicle, such as a mobile master node, detects a signal broadcast from an id node associated with the shipping location, and instructs the id node to lower a power level of the broadcast signal. the mobile master node identifies the signal broadcast from the id node with the lowered power level, and determines a direction of the id node relative to the mobile master node based upon the detected signal with the lowered power level. the mobile master node then navigates to the id node associated with the shipping location based upon the determined direction, which may involve providing the determined direction to an input for the vehicle's control system."
