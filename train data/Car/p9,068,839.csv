" an approach for providing shadow-based location positioning is described. a visual location platform processes and/or facilitates a processing of sensor information associated with at least one device traveling on at least one route to determine at least one pattern of shadows on the at least one route. the visual location platform also causes, at least in part, a comparison of the at least one pattern of shadows against one or more reference patterns of shadows associated with one or more known locations. the service platform further causes, at least in part, an estimation of a location, a direction of travel, or a combination thereof of the at least one device based, at least in part, on the comparison."
