" in one exemplary embodiment, a method includes obtaining a digital image of an object. a coordinate-space position of a digital camera is defined in relation to the digital object for the digital image. a coordinate-space region around the coordinate-space position is defined. the coordinate-space region is associated with the digital image based on the coordinate-space position defined for the digital image. a digital image of a room is obtained. a three-dimensional representation of the digital image of the room is created according to the coordinate system based on the positional information of another digital camera that obtained the digital image of the room. an object proxy is located in the three-dimensional representation of the digital image. a coordinate-space region of the room of the object proxy is mapped with a substantially matching coordinate-space region of the object. the digital image of the object associated with substantially matching coordinate-space region is overlaid onto the digital image of the room."
