" an approach is provided for determining a position of a vehicle relative to a travel path based on driving behavior. an estimation platform processes driving information associated with a vehicle, mapping information associated with a segment of the travel path in use by the vehicle, or a combination thereof to determine a behavior trace to associate with the vehicle. the estimation platform also determines an offset between the behavior trace of the vehicle and the behavior trace of one or more other vehicles based on a matching between the behavior trace of the vehicle and the behavior trace of the one or more other vehicles relative to the segment of the travel path."
