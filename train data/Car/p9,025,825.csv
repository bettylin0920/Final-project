" the pmp growth algorithm described herein provides for image tracking, segmentation and processing in environments where the camera system moves around a great deal, i.e., causing image jumps from one image frame to the next. it also is operative in systems where the objects themselves are making quick movements that alter their path. attributes of the pmp growth algorithm allow tracking systems using the pmp growth algorithm to follow objects a long distance in a scene. this detection and tracking method is designed to track objects within a sequence of video image frames, and includes detecting keypoints in a current image frame of the video image frames, assigning local appearance features to the detected keypoints, establishing point-motion-pairs between two successive image frames of the video image frames, and accumulating additional matches between image locations to form complete coherent motion object models of the objects being tracked. the segmentation aspect permits for the discovery of different coherently moving regions in the images."
