" a magnetically actuated node apparatus and methods of its operation are described involving interaction with a master node that communicates with a server in a wireless node network. as part of magnetically altering an operation of a node in a wireless node network having a master node operative to communicate with a server, the node detects one or more magnetic field changes in a proximate environment of the node (such as a sensing an altered configuration of a magnetic switch integrated within the node). the node then alters a management function of the node (such as changing a power condition of the node that may override a prior power setting) in response to the detected one or more magnetic field changes. the node further transmits to the master node information about the altered management function (such as a movement alert and/or location information) to be forwarded to the server."
