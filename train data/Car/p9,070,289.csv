" a method and system for measurement of ground based vehicle speed includes a movable platform that includes an unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) located in proximity to a roadway, the uav operates under control and navigation of a uav control unit, and the uav also carries camera and monitoring equipment, the camera and monitoring equipment including an onboard computing system, and a camera with a wide angle lens and a camera with a telephoto lens, the cameras being mounted on a pan/tilt device. an algorithm operated by the on-board computing system is used to detect and track vehicles moving on a roadway. the algorithm is configured to detect and track the vehicles despite motion created by movement of the uav. the cameras mounted on the pan/tilt device are moved under the direction of the computer vision algorithm to maintain a target vehicle of the detected moving vehicles in view, and the speed of the target vehicle is measured."
