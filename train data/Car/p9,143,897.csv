" an approach is provided for an application engine (e.g., a gaming engine) based on real-time location-based data. in one embodiment, an application engine determines one or more location-based data sources associated with at least one device. the one or more location-based data sources are determined in at least substantially real-time while the at least one device is engaged in at least one travel activity. the application engine then determines one or more elements of an application engine based, at least in part, on the one or more location-based data sources. the application engine causes, at least in part, the one or more elements at the least one device during the at least one travel activity. in one embodiment, the application engine also causes, at least in part, a transformation of the one or more map data elements based, at least in part, on the one or more location-based data sources."
