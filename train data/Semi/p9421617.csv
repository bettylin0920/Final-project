" a rotary chuck adapted to hold a substrate. the rotary chuck has a rotatable chuck portion and an edge grip having a movable grip member movably mounted to the rotatable chuck portion, the moveable grip member being substantially free moving so that rotation of the rotating chuck portion causes the moveable grip member to move in a plane substantially aligned with a surface of the substrate to engage the substrate in a engaged position. a resilient element is coupled to the moveable grip member, the resilient member biasing the grip member to a disengaged position."
