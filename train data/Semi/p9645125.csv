" a method of measuring an atmosphere in a guest vacuum chamber of a vacuum tool includes measuring a first composition of the atmosphere in the host vacuum chamber using a residual gas analyzer (rga). the host and guest vacuum chambers are not coupled during the measuring of the first composition. the host vacuum chamber is coupled to the guest vacuum chamber, so the atmospheres in each can mix in the host vacuum chamber. a second composition of the atmosphere in the host vacuum chamber is measured using the rga after the chambers are coupled. using a processor, a composition of the guest atmosphere is automatically determined using the measured first and second compositions. a vacuum tool can include the host and guest chambers, the valve, the rga, and a processor configured to control the valve to carry out this or other methods."
