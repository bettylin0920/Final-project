" methods of selectively etching tungsten from the surface of a patterned substrate are described. the methods electrically separate vertically arranged tungsten slabs from one another as needed. the vertically arranged tungsten slabs may form the walls of a trench during manufacture of a vertical flash memory cell. the tungsten etch may selectively remove tungsten relative to films such as silicon, polysilicon, silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, titanium nitride and silicon nitride. the methods include exposing electrically-shorted tungsten slabs to remotely-excited fluorine formed in a remote plasma region. process parameters are provided which result in uniform tungsten recess within the trench. a low electron temperature is maintained in the substrate processing region to achieve high etch selectivity and uniform removal throughout the trench."
