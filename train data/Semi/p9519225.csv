" the present disclosure provides a lithography system comprising a radiation source and an exposure tool including a plurality of exposure columns densely packed in a first direction. each exposure column includes an exposure area configured to pass the radiation source. the system also includes a wafer carrier configured to secure and move one or more wafers along a second direction that is perpendicular to the first direction, so that the one or more wafers are exposed by the exposure tool to form patterns along the second direction. the one or more wafers are covered with resist layer and aligned in the second direction on the wafer carrier."
