" disclosed are systems, devices and methodologies for handling wafers in wafer processing operations through use of wafer carriers. in an example situation, a wafer carrier can be configured as a plate to allow bonding of a wafer thereto to provide support for the wafer during some processing operations. upon completion of such operations, the processed wafer can be separated from the support plate so as to allow further processing. various devices and methodologies related to such wafer carriers for efficient handling of wafers are disclosed."
