" systems and methods for identifying defective individual packaged modules are presented. a printed circuit board (pcb) having a set of individual module substrates can be received. further, capturing an image of the pcb and loading a pcb recipe associated with the pcb can be performed. the image of the pcb can be captured by an image capture module that can include one or more cameras. for each individual module substrate, a portion of the image corresponding to the individual module substrate can be compared to the pcb recipe. in addition, it can be determined based on the comparison whether the individual module substrate matches the pcb recipe within a degree of tolerance. in response to determining that the individual module substrate does not match the pcb recipe within the degree of tolerance, a location of the individual module substrate within a map of the pcb can be stored."
