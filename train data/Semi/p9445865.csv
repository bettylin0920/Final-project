" an electrosurgical instrument includes a housing, an elongated shaft, and an end-effector assembly. the proximal end of the shaft is operably associated with the housing. the end-effector assembly is operably coupled to the distal end of the shaft and includes first and second jaw members. each of the first and second jaw members includes a sealing plate and a bipolar electrode. either one or both of the first and second jaw members is movable from a position in spaced relation relative to the other jaw member to at least one subsequent position wherein the sealing plates cooperate to grasp tissue therebetween. the electrosurgical instrument includes a semiconductor switch operably coupled to at least one of the sealing plates and at least one of the bipolar electrodes. the semiconductor switch is configured to enable user selection between energizing the at least one sealing plate or the at least one bipolar electrode."
