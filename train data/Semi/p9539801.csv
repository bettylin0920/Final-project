" a first surface of a debonder defines a recess that holds an assembly that includes a wafer bonded to a carrier plate having a first diameter that is larger than a second diameter of the wafer. the plate includes a peripheral area not covered by the wafer, and when the wafer of the assembly is placed within the recess, a portion of the peripheral area of the plate engages a portion of the first surface. a second surface of the debonder is disposed in the recess and is separated from the first surface. the second surface includes suction openings that deliver suction to the recess. a third surface of the debonder substantially connects the first and the second surfaces and includes an opening dimensioned to limit a pressure differential between the recess and outside the recess during application of the suction."
