" a control method includes empirically constructing for a flexible manipulator an estimated mapping between an end-effector movement and a plurality of values representing movement of at least one actuator, measuring an actual end-effector movement and an actual movement of the at least one actuator, and, based on the measuring, updating the estimated mapping while the flexible manipulator is active such that the mapping is adapted to the present environment of the flexible manipulator."
