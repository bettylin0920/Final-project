" a system for epitaxial deposition of a group iii-v semiconductor material that includes gallium. the system includes sources of the reactants, one of which is a gaseous group iii precursor having one or more gaseous gallium precursors and another of which is a gaseous group v component, a reaction chamber wherein the reactants combine to deposit group iii-v semiconductor material, and one or more heating structures for heating the gaseous group iii precursors prior to reacting to a temperature to decompose substantially all dimers, trimers or other molecular variations of such precursors into their monomer forms."
