" methods of selectively etching metal-containing materials from the surface of a substrate are described. the etch selectively removes metal-containing materials relative to silicon-containing films such as silicon, polysilicon, silicon oxide, silicon germanium, silicon carbide, silicon carbon nitride and/or silicon nitride. the methods include exposing metal-containing materials to halogen containing species in a substrate processing region. no plasma excites the halogen-containing precursor either remotely or locally in embodiments."
