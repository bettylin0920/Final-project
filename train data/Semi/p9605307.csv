" techniques for forming a nanopore in a lipid bilayer are described herein. in one example, an agitation stimulus level such as an electrical agitation stimulus is applied to a lipid bilayer wherein the agitation stimulus level tends to facilitate the formation of nanopores in the lipid bilayer. in some embodiments, a change in an electrical property of the lipid bilayer resulting from the formation of the nanopore in the lipid bilayer is detected, and a nanopore has formed in the lipid bilayer is determined based on the detected change in the lipid bilayer electrical property."
