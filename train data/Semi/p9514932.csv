" methods are described for forming flowable carbon layers on a semiconductor substrate. a local excitation (such as a hot filament in hot wire cvd, a plasma in pecvd or uv light) may be applied as described herein to a silicon-free carbon-containing precursor containing a hydrocarbon to form a flowable carbon-containing film on a substrate. a remote excitation method has also been found to produce flowable carbon-containing films by exciting a stable precursor to produce a radical precursor which is then combined with unexcited silicon-free carbon-containing precursors in the substrate processing region."
