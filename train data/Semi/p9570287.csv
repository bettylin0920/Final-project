" methods for depositing and curing a flowable dielectric layer are disclosed herein. methods can include forming a flowable dielectric layer, immersing the flowable dielectric layer in an oxygen-containing gas, purging the chamber and curing the layer with uv radiation. by curing the layer after an oxygen-containing gas pre-soak, the layer can be more completely cured during the uv irradiation."
