" in one embodiment, an endoscopic camera for a robotic surgical system includes a stereo camera module mounted to a robotic arm of a patient side cart. the optical and electro-optic components of the camera module are hermetically sealed within a first housing. signals from an electro-optic component travel through traces in a ceramic substrate forming one side of the hermetically sealed first housing. a second housing surrounds the first housing and optical fibers are dispersed between the housings to provide lighting in a body cavity. the camera module may be sterilized by an autoclave."
