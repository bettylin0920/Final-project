" aspects of the disclosure pertain to methods of forming planar amorphous carbon layers on patterned substrates. layers formed according to embodiments outlined herein have may improve manufacturing yield by making the top surface of an amorphous carbon layer more planar despite underlying topography or stoichiometric variations. the amorphous carbon layers may comprise carbon and hydrogen, may consist of carbon and hydrogen or may comprise or consist of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen in embodiments. methods described herein may comprise introducing a hydrogen-containing precursor at a relatively high ratio relative to a hydrocarbon into a substrate processing region and concurrently applying a local plasma power capacitively to the substrate processing region to form the planar layer. alternatively an atomic flow ratio of hydrogen:carbon may begin low and increase discretely or smoothly during formation of the amorphous carbon layer."
