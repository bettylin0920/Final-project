" a method is described for protecting photovoltaic cells. during the fabrication process, a photovoltaic cell can be received from a first processing station. the photovoltaic cell can have at least one exposed surface, which may include crystalline silicon or oxidized crystalline silicon. the photovoltaic cell can then be placed in a controlled microenvironment with controlled chemical content, which can protect the exposed surface of the photovoltaic cell from contamination. subsequently, the photovoltaic cell can be moved toward and delivered to a second processing station in the controlled microenvironment."
