" a method performed at a cell site with an unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) communicatively coupled to a controller to perform a cell site audit, without requiring a tower climb at the cell site, includes causing the uav to fly substantially vertically up to cell site components using the controller, wherein flight of the uav is constrained in a three-dimensional rectangle at the cell site; collecting data associated with the cell site components and the surrounding airspace and environment using the uav; transmitting and/or storing the collected data; and processing the collected data to obtain information for the cell site audit."
