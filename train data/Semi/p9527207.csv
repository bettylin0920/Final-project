 a robotic manipulator has a body and a stereoscopic video system movably coupled to the body. the stereoscopic vision system produces a stereoscopic video of an environment of the robotic manipulator. the robotic manipulator also includes two independently remotely controlled arms coupled to opposite sides of the body. each arm moves in proprioceptive alignment with the stereoscopic video produced by the stereoscopic video system in response to commands received from a remote control station based on movements performed by an operator at the remote control station.
