" example implementations may relate to methods and systems for disturbing or deceiving sensors of robotic devices. accordingly, a computing system may detect that a robotic device has entered a particular physical region. responsively, the computing system may then determine at least one type of sensor that is associated with the robotic device and is used to detect reflected illumination that is reflected from an object. based on the determined at least one type of sensor, the computing system may then select (i) at least one particular type of disturbing illumination and (ii) a target location within the particular physical region. upon the selection, the computing system may direct at least one light source to emit the selected at least one particular type of disturbing illumination towards the selected target location so as to disturb the reflected illumination detectable by the robotic device using the at least one type of sensor."
