" in one implementation, a method is disclosed in which a lock sensing mode is entered for a robotic surgical instrument. in the lock sensing mode, the degrees of freedom of movement in the robotic surgical instrument are switchably reduced. further in the lock sensing mode, one or more end effectors of the robotic surgical instrument are switchably clamped together in the robotic surgical instrument. an increased level of torque may also be applied to the end effectors to increase a gripping force applied by the one or more end effectors in response to the reduced degrees of freedom of movement in the robotic surgical instrument."
