" a motion sensor applicable to medical procedures includes a source of light with a wavelength bandwidth and an optical detector. a first optical coupler terminates in a first probe tip and couples the light into the first probe tip. a second optical coupler terminates in a second probe tip and directs onto the detector scattered light returning through the second probe tip. a presentation device outputs a signal that indicates motion in a target volume of a sample in a vicinity of the probe tips based on a doppler shift of the scattered light. the volume depends on coherence distance determined by the bandwidth. in variations, the first and second tips are the same tip, a multimode fiber is included, the bandwidth is between 0.1% and 5% of a center wavelength, or the presentation device is a speaker, or some combination."
