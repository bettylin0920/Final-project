" according to one embodiment, a virtual tape library (vtl) receives a plurality of small computer system interface (scsi) data objects, and translates the scsi data objects into a first set of one or more remote procedure call (rpc) data objects having a first size, wherein the first size of the first rpc data set is based on a current limit maintained by the vtl. the vtl writes the first rpc data set and a first rpc commit request to a file system. the vtl receives a first rpc status corresponding to the first rpc commit from the file system, and determines a first latency time between writing the first rpc commit and receiving the first rpc status. the vtl updates the current limit based on the first latency time in order to optimize a second latency time between a second rpc commit request and a corresponding second rpc status."
