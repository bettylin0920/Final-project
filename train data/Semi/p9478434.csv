 a method of removing titanium nitride hardmask is described. the hardmask resides above a low-k dielectric layer prior to removal and the low-k dielectric layer retains a relatively low net dielectric constant after the removal process. the low-k dielectric layer may be part of a dual damascene structure having copper at the bottom of the vias. a non-porous carbon layer is deposited prior to the titanium nitride hardmask removal to protect the low-k dielectric layer and the copper. the titanium nitride hardmask is removed with a gas-phase etch using plasma effluents formed in a remote plasma from a chlorine-containing precursor. plasma effluents within the remote plasma are flowed into a substrate processing region where the plasma effluents react with the titanium nitride.
