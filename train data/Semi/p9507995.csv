" methods and systems for determining depth information using a combination of stereo and structured-light processing are provided. an example method involves receiving a plurality of images captured with at least two optical sensors, and determining a first depth estimate for at least one surface based on corresponding features between a first image and a second image. further, the method involves causing a texture projector to project a known texture pattern, and determining, based on the first depth estimate, at least one region of at least one image of the plurality of images within which to search for a particular portion of the known texture pattern. and the method involves determining points corresponding to the particular portion of the known texture pattern within the at least one region, and determining a second depth estimate for the at least one surface based on the determined points corresponding to the known texture pattern."
