" a first surface of a debonder defines a recess to hold an assembly that includes a wafer bonded to a carrier plate having a first diameter that is larger than a second diameter of the wafer. the carrier plate includes a peripheral area not covered by the wafer, and when the wafer of the assembly is placed within the recess, a portion of the peripheral area of the carrier plate engages a portion of the first surface. a second surface of the debonder is disposed in the recess and is separated from the first surface, where the second surface includes suction openings that deliver a suction force to the recess, and a portion of the second surface is in contact with a heat source."
