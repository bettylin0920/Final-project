" an approach is provided for enabling hover-based interactions to define spatial searches on mobile maps. a user interaction manager causes, at least in part, a rendering of at least one user interface depicting mapping information. a user interaction manager then processes and/or facilitates a processing of one or more hover-based interactions with the at least one user interface to determine one or more parameters for one or more spatial searches over the mapping information."
