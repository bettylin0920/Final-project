" a robotic end effector includes a finger and at least one actuator. the finger extends from a proximal end to a distal end along a finger axis. the finger includes a first phalanx proximate the proximal end, a second phalanx proximate the distal end, and a knuckle joint including at least one vertebra interposed between and separating the first and second phalanxes. the knuckle joint is configured to permit the second phalanx to pivot relative to the first phalanx about a pivot axis transverse to the finger axis. each vertebra has an axial thickness extending along the finger axis and a lateral width extending perpendicular to its axial thickness, and its lateral width is greater than its axial thickness. the at least one actuator is operable to move the second phalanx relative to the first phalanx about the pivot axis."
