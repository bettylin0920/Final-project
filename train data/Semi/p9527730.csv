 methods and devices for preparing microscale polymer relief structures from a thin polymer layer on an absorbing substrate are described. the described methods are ultrafast (about 8 nanoseconds) and allow formation of patterned microstructures having complex morphologies and narrow line widths that are an order of magnitude smaller than the masks used in the methods.
