" the present invention provides an approach for the determination of the activation state of discrete cell populations and/or the state of one or more cellular networks in an individual, when modulated with a modulator that acts on one cell population to communicate with other cell populations in the network. the status of discrete cell populations and/or the state of one or more cellular networks can be correlated with the diagnosis, prognosis, choice or modification of treatment, and/or monitoring of a condition, and with screening of agents."
