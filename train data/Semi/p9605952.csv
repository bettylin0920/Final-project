 a displacement measuring cell may be used to measure linear and/or angular displacement. the displacement measuring cell may include movable and stationary electrodes in a conductive fluid. electrical property measurements may be used to determine how far the movable electrode has moved relative to the stationary electrode. the displacement measuring cell may include pistons and/or flexible walls. the displacement measuring cell may be used in a touch-sensitive robotic gripper. the touch-sensitive robotic gripper may include a plurality of displacement measuring cells mechanically in series and/or parallel. the touch-sensitive robotic gripper may be include a processor and/or memory configured to identify objects based on displacement measurements and/or other measurements. the processor may determine how to manipulate the object based on its identity.
