" techniques that palletize bundles at high-speed. a robotic controller includes a vision system that determines a location and orientation of incoming bundles, a tracking system that communicates between the controller and a conveyor, and a robot that coordinates its movement with the bundles. the tracking system identifies the location and orientation of each bundle, informs the controller, and causes the robot to track its location and orientation with incoming bundles. the controller receives information on the location and orientation of each bundle. the controller instructs the robot to move in coordination with each incoming bundle, instructs the robot where and at what orientation to pick up the bundle, and instructs the robot how to move the bundle to a tier-and-stacking position. the controller can instruct the robot how to pick up each bundle on the fly as the bundle moves into range on the incoming conveyor."
