" a method of etching exposed silicon on patterned heterogeneous structures is described and includes a gas phase etch using plasma effluents formed in a remote plasma. the remote plasma excites a fluorine-containing precursor. plasma effluents within the remote plasma are flowed into a substrate processing region where the plasma effluents combine with a hydrogen-containing precursor. the combination reacts with the patterned heterogeneous structures to remove an exposed silicon portion faster than a second exposed portion. the silicon selectivity results from the presence of an ion suppressor positioned between the remote plasma and the substrate processing region. the methods may be used to selectively remove silicon faster than silicon oxide, silicon nitride and a variety of metal-containing materials. the methods may be used to remove small etch amounts in a controlled manner and may result in an extremely smooth silicon surface."
