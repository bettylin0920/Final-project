" a high throughput system for warming a wafer to a desired temperature after undergoing a low-temperature implantation process includes an implantation chamber, a wafer warming chamber configured to uniformly warm a single wafer, and a plurality of robotic arms to transfer wafers throughout the system. at each stage in the fabrication process, the robotic arms simultaneously work with multiple wafers and, therefore, the system provides a high throughput process. also, the warming chamber may be a vacuum environment, thus eliminating the mist-condensation problem that results in wafer spotting."
