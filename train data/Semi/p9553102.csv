" methods of selectively etching tungsten from the surface of a patterned substrate are described. the etch electrically separates vertically arranged tungsten slabs from one another as needed, for example, in the manufacture of vertical flash memory devices. the tungsten etch may selectively remove tungsten relative to films such as silicon, polysilicon, silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, titanium nitride and silicon nitride. the methods include exposing electrically-shorted tungsten slabs to remotely-excited fluorine formed in a capacitively-excited chamber plasma region. the methods then include exposing the tungsten slabs to remotely-excited fluorine formed in an inductively-excited remote plasma system. a low electron temperature is maintained in the substrate processing region during each operation to achieve high etch selectivity."
