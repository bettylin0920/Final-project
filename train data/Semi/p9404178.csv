" a method of forming a dielectric layer is described. the method first deposits a silicon-nitrogen-and-hydrogen-containing (polysilazane) layer by radical-component chemical vapor deposition (cvd). the silicon-nitrogen-and-hydrogen-containing layer is formed by combining a radical precursor (excited in a remote plasma) with an unexcited carbon-free silicon precursor. a silicon oxide capping layer may be formed from a portion of the carbon-free silicon-nitrogen-and-hydrogen-containing layer to avoid time-evolution of underlying layer properties prior to conversion into silicon oxide. alternatively, the silicon oxide capping layer is formed over the silicon-nitrogen-and-hydrogen-containing layer. either method of formation involves the formation of a local plasma within the substrate processing region."
