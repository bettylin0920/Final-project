" described herein are improved configurations for providing a stranded printed circuit board trace comprising, a plurality of conductor layers, a plurality of individual conductor traces on each of the said conductor layers, and a plurality of vias for connecting individual conductor traces on different said conductor layers, the vias located on the outside edges of the stranded trace. the individual conductor traces of each layer may be routed from vias on one side of the stranded printed circuit board trace to vias on the other side in a substantially diagonal direction with respect to the axis of the stranded printed circuit board trace. in embodiments, the stranded printed circuit board trace configuration may be applied to a wireless power transfer system."
