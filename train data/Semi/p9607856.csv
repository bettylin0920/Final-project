" methods are described herein for selectively etching titanium nitride relative to dielectric films, which may include, for example, alternative metals and metal oxides lacking in titanium and/or silicon-containing films (e.g. silicon oxide, silicon carbon nitride and low-k dielectric films). the methods include a remote plasma etch formed from a chlorine-containing precursor. plasma effluents from the remote plasma are flowed into a substrate processing region where the plasma effluents react with the titanium nitride. the plasma effluents react with exposed surfaces and selectively remove titanium nitride while very slowly removing the other exposed materials. the substrate processing region may also contain a plasma to facilitate breaking through any titanium oxide layer present on the titanium nitride. the plasma in the substrate processing region may be gently biased relative to the substrate to enhance removal rate of the titanium oxide layer."
