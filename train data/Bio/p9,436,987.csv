" a stereo camera system produces a stereo image pair of a cable harness, which is used to define a 3d point cloud of the cable harness at its current pose position. pose information of specific parts of the cable harness are determined from the 3d point cloud, and the cable harness is then re-presented as a collection of primitive geometric shapes of known dimensions, whose positions and orientations follow the spatial position and orientation of the imaged cable harness. the length, position and number of geometric shapes are atomically determined from a 2d image segmentation of one of the images in the stereo image pair."
