" an instrument system that includes an elongate body, an optical fiber, a localization sensor and a controller is provided. the optical fiber is operatively coupled to the elongate body and has a strain sensor provided on the optical fiber. the localization sensor is operatively coupled to the elongate body. the controller is operatively coupled to the optical fiber and to the localization sensor and is adapted to receive a first signal from the strain sensor, receive a second signal from the localization sensor, and determine a position or orientation of the elongate body based on the first signal and the second signal."
