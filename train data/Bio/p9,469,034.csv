" a medical robotic system includes articulated instruments extending out of a distal end of an entry guide. prior to pivoting the entry guide to re-orient it and the instruments, the instruments are moved in tandem back towards the entry guide after a delay. haptic cues and velocity limits are provided to assist the operator in the retraction of the instruments. after retraction, the entry guide may then be pivoted without concern that the instruments will harm patient anatomy. the movement of the instruments in tandem back towards the entry guide may also occur through coupled control modes while the entry guide is held in a fixed position and orientation."
