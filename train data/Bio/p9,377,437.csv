" techniques for characterizing a molecule are described herein. in one example, a portion of the molecule is trapped in a nanopore, a variable voltage is applied across the nanopore until the trapped portion of molecule is moved within the nanopore, and the molecule is characterized based on the electrical stimulus required to affect movement of at least a portion of the trapped portion of the molecule within the nanopore."
