" a surgical device for clipping tissue can include an actuator, such as a handle or a robotic arm, for example, and a replaceable end effector including a plurality of clips contained therein. after the replaceable end effector has been used, the end effector can be detached from the actuator and a new end effector can be operably coupled with the actuator. each replaceable end effector can include a firing drive for advancing clips into a receiver of the end effector and a crimping drive configured to deform a clip positioned within the receiver."
