" described herein are improved configurations for resonator for wireless power transfer that includes a magnetic material having at least one hollow section, and at least one electrical conductor wrapped around the magnetic material. the cavity of the magnetic material may be used for lossy elements such as circuit boards or electronics with reduced perturbations on the properties of the resonator compared to if the lossy elements were outside of the magnetic material next to the resonator."
