" various example embodiments are directed towards a system and method for closed feedback control of a robotically controlled electrosurgical instrument. in one embodiment, the method comprises applying at least one electrosurgical signal to an electrosurgical end effector a robotically controlled surgical instrument. a feedback signal may be generated by the electrosurgical end effector and provided to a control logic. the control logic may be configured to determine a rate of change of the impedance of a target tissue based on the feedback signal received from the electrosurgical end effector. the control logic may be configured to control or modify the at least one electrosurgical signal such that the rate of change of impedance determined from the feedback signal is maintained at a predetermined rate or within a predetermined range."
