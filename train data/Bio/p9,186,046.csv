" robotic medical instrument systems and associated methods utilizing an optical fiber sensors such as bragg sensor optical fibers. in one configuration, an optical fiber is coupled to an elongate instrument body and includes a fiber core having one or more bragg gratings. a controller is configured to initiate various actions in response thereto. for example, a controller may generate and display a graphical representation of the instrument body and depict one or more position and/or orientation variables thereof, or adjust motors of an instrument driver to reposition the catheter or another instrument. optical fibers having bragg gratings may also be utilized with other system components including a plurality of working instruments that are positioned within a sheath lumen, an instrument driver, localization sensors, and/or an image capture device, and may also be coupled to a patient's body or associated structure that stabilizes the body."
