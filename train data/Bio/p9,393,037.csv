" various embodiments described herein are directed to ultrasonic blades. for example, an ultrasonic blade may comprise a proximally positioned straight section extending along a longitudinal axis and a distally positioned curved section coupled to the straight section and curved away from the longitudinal axis. the curved section may define a radius of curvature and subtend a first angle. a point of tangency between the curved section and the straight section may be positioned at either a node of the ultrasonic blade or an anti-node of the ultrasonic blade."
