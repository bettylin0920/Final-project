 described herein are configurations for an integrated resonator-shield structure for wireless power transfer. in embodiments a conductor shield is used to shield the resonator from perturbing objects. in embodiments the conductor shield is used for a current return path for the conductors of the resonator. the resonator shield can be divided into separate conductor segments to tailor the current distributions in the conductor shield.
