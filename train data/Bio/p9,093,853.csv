" described herein are improved configurations for a wireless power transfer for electronic devices. in embodiments reconfigurable or flexible attachment between a source and a device is realized using permanent magnets or electromagnets. magnetic material may be positioned on or around one or more of the resonator to provide for locations for attaching permanent magnets. a permanent magnet attached to or near one of a source or device or repeater resonators may be used to flexibly attach to the non-lossy magnetic material of another resonator structure. in embodiments, replacing lossy permanent magnets and/or electromagnets in even one of the resonators of a wireless power system may be advantageous to system performance."
