" techniques for enhanced microfluidic impedance spectroscopy include causing a core fluid to flow into a channel between two sheath flows of one or more sheath fluids different from the core fluid. flow in the channel is laminar. a dielectric constant of a fluid constituting either sheath flow is much less than a dielectric constant of the core fluid. electrical impedance is measured in the channel between at least a first pair of electrodes. in some embodiments, enhanced optical measurements include causing a core fluid to flow into a channel between two sheath flows of one or more sheath fluids different from the core fluid. an optical index of refraction of a fluid constituting either sheath flow is much less than an optical index of refraction of the core fluid. an optical property is measured in the channel."
