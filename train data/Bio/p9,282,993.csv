" the present invention is a distally assembled steerable cannula (dasc), a robotically-manipulated device that can be deployed and extended within a patient's body by growing from its distal end, or can be used in non-medical applications. in one embodiment, growth occurs by sequentially assembling segments that interlock to form a rigid tube with a complex 3-d shape. the segments are individually transported through the growing cannula, and then assembled at the distal end. a segment can be wedge-shaped in profile, allowing adjustment of the local radius of curvature and direction of the cannula to be controlled by relative segment orientation."
