" described herein are improved configurations for a wireless power transfer for electronic devices that include at least one source magnetic resonator including a capacitively-loaded conducting loop coupled to a power source and configured to generate an oscillating magnetic field and at least one device magnetic resonator, distal from said source resonators, comprising a capacitively-loaded conducting loop configured to convert said oscillating magnetic fields into electrical energy, wherein at least one said resonator has a keep-out zone around the resonator that surrounds the resonator with a layer of non-lossy material."
