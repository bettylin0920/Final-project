" a method of maintaining an information rate of a brain-computer interface (bci) system, implanted in a patient's brain, by regulating arousal level in the patient's brain is disclosed. the method includes selecting a patient with the implanted bci device configured to receive neuronal activity from one or more electrodes connected to the patient's brain and to establish a communication channel between the patient and an external device controlled by the patient. accordingly, a rate of information passage through the communication channel from the bci device is measured, and a region of the patient's brain involved in arousal regulation, is stimulated in response to said measuring, under conditions effective to adjust the rate of information passing from the bci device through the communication channel. a computer medium for carrying out this method and a bci arousal regulation system are also disclosed."
