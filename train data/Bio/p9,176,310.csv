" one embodiment of techniques for confocal microscopy includes illuminating a spot on a surface of a biological sample. a first emission intensity from the spot is detected in a first range of optical properties; and a second emission intensity in a second range. a pixel that corresponds to the spot is colored using a linear combination of the first and second emission intensities. sometimes, the pixel is colored to approximate a color produced by histology. in some embodiments, a surface of a sample is contacted with a solution of acridine orange. then, a spot is illuminated with a laser beam of wavelength about 488 nanometers (nm). fluorescence emission intensity is detected above about 500 nm. sometimes, a certain illumination correction is applied. in some embodiments, a sample holder that compresses a sample is removable from a stage that is fixed with respect to a focal plane of the microscope."
