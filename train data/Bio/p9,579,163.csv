" robotic platform for mini-invasive surgery comprising robotic arms (4a, 4b) suitable to be placed in the body of a patient, introduced through a single access port, which are an extension of external robotic manipulators (19). the continuity between external (1) and internal (4a, 4b) robotic arms is guaranteed by means of a trans-abdominal magnetic connection (6) between the internal robotic arm integral with the external one. the trans-abdominal magnetic coupling not only guarantees a stable anchoring, but most of all it transfers degrees of freedom to the internal robotic arms, inducing the motion of internal magnets by means of the automatized motion of external magnets. it is also possible to reposition the internal robotic arms without requiring having to additionally perform incisions on the abdomen. using the external robotic arms allows translating the internal ones on the entire abdomen thus providing a working space not bound to the point of insertion and theoretically unlimited."
