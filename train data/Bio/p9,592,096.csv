" the robotic device for positioning a surgical instrument relative to the body of a patient includes a first robotic arm with a device for rigidly connecting to at least one surgical instrument, a device for anatomical realignment of the first arm by realigning an image that is of an area of the anatomy of the patient, and a device for compensating the movements of the first arm on the basis of detected movements. one version of the device includes at least one second robotic arm having sensors for detecting inner movements of the anatomical area, and a device for controlling the positioning of the first arm relative to sensed inner movements and to the outer movements induced in the second arm."
