" a robot is made to recognize and manipulate different types of cable harnesses in an assembly line. this is achieved by using a stereo camera system to define a 3d cloud of a given cable harness. pose information of specific parts of the cable harness are determined from the 3d point cloud, and the cable harness is then re-presented as a collection of primitive geometric shapes of known dimensions, whose positions and orientations follow the spatial position of the represented cable harness. the robot can then manipulate the cable harness by using the simplified representation as a reference."
