" a device for establishing an access channel to a target location is presented. the device includes a plurality of cylindrical segments. a plurality of backbones each extends through a backbone channel of each segment to join the plurality of segments together. when joined together, the central bore of each of the plurality of cylindrical segments align to form an access channel. a distal segment is fixedly attached to each of the plurality of backbones such that an orientation of the distal segment can be adjusted by linear movement of one or more of the plurality of backbones through the plurality of cylindrical segments. furthermore, when linear movement of the plurality of backbones is restricted, the shape of the access channel can be adjusted by external forces while maintaining the orientation of the distal segment."
