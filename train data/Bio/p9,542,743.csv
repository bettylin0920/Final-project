" systems and methods are disclosed that determine a mapping between a first camera system's coordinate system and a second camera system's coordinate system; or determine a transformation between a robot's coordinate system and a camera system's coordinate system, and/or locate, in a robot's coordinate system, a tool extending from an arm of the robot based on the tool location in the camera's coordinate system. the disclosed systems and methods may use transformations derived from coordinates of features found in one or more images. the transformations may be used to interrelate various coordinate systems, facilitating calibration of camera systems, including in robotic systems, such as an image-guided robotic systems for hair harvesting and/or implantation."
